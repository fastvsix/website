        "Shrek" is a 2001 American computer-animated comedy film directed by Andrew Adamson and Vicky Jenson.
         The film was produced by DreamWorks Animation and is loosely based on William Steig's 1990 fairy tale picture book of the same name. 
         The film stars the voices of Mike Myers, Eddie Murphy, Cameron Diaz, and John Lithgow.
    The story follows an ogre named Shrek who lives in a swamp and wants to be left alone. However, his life is disrupted when a large number of fairy tale creatures are banished from the kingdom of Duloc and seek refuge in his swamp. 
        Shrek agrees to help the banished creatures if the evil Lord Farquaad will give him back his swamp, which Farquaad has taken. Along the way, Shrek meets and falls in love with a Princess named Fiona, who is under a curse that transforms her into an ogre at night.
        The film was a critical and commercial success, grossing over $484 million worldwide and winning the first Academy Award for Best Animated Feature.
         It was followed by three sequels, "Shrek 2" (2004), "Shrek the Third" (2007), and "Shrek Forever After" (2010), as well as numerous spin-off films and merchandise. "Shrek" is widely considered to be one of the most successful film franchises of all time.
